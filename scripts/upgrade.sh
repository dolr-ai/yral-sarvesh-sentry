# yral-sarvesh-sentry — safe upgrade script (runs ON sarvesh-3)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#
# Upgrading self-hosted Sentry means moving from one upstream release tag
# to another (e.g. 26.6.0 → 26.5.0). The upstream `getsentry/self-hosted`
# `install.sh` handles database migrations, Clickhouse schema changes,
# Kafka topic updates, etc. — but it does NOT handle "I want to upgrade
# cautiously with a dry-run first."
#
# This wrapper adds:
#
#   1. **Changelog reminder** — echoes the link to the changelog and
#      refuses to proceed unless the caller sets CONFIRMED_READ_CHANGELOG=1.
#      This catches the "blindly bumped SENTRY_VERSION" mistake.
#
#   2. **Dry-run mode** — if called with `--dry-run`, runs `docker compose
#      pull` for the new image tags but does NOT stop the running stack.
#      Confirms the images exist and can be fetched before committing.
#
#   3. **Rollback note** — on failure, prints the exact rollback
#      commands. Upstream does NOT support down-migrations. There is
#      NO automated backup (removed 2026-04-23) — a failed upgrade
#      that corrupts Sentry's Postgres requires manual recovery:
#      recreate projects, re-issue DSNs, redeploy each reporting
#      service. Roughly 45-60 min for our current 2 services. This
#      is the consciously-accepted trade-off; re-read the rationale
#      in PROGRESS.md before adding backup back.
#
# HOW TO USE:
#
#   Dry-run first:
#     # edit project.config, bump SENTRY_VERSION to new tag
#     CONFIRMED_READ_CHANGELOG=1 bash scripts/upgrade.sh --dry-run
#
#   Then the real upgrade:
#     CONFIRMED_READ_CHANGELOG=1 bash scripts/upgrade.sh
#
# BLAST RADIUS: this script stops Sentry for 5-20 minutes during the real
# upgrade. Schedule during low-traffic hours. Events arriving during the
# window are handled by SDK local buffering — they re-send once Sentry
# comes back — but you'll miss the real-time UI feedback.

WARNING: No backup will be taken before this upgrade.

If the upgrade corrupts Sentry's Postgres you will lose all
project metadata (projects, DSNs, teams, user accounts, alert
rules). Recovery = recreate projects + rotate DSNs + redeploy
each service. ~45-60 min for our 2 services.

Rollback:

  2. Re-run:                         bash ${REPO_DIR}/scripts/install.sh
  3. If Postgres is corrupted (unlikely; upstream migrations are careful):
     recreate projects + DSNs in the Sentry UI, redeploy each reporting
     service with its new DSN. No automated restore path (backup was
     intentionally removed 2026-04-23 — see PROGRESS.md).
