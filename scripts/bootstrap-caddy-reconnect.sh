# yral-sarvesh-sentry — bootstrap Caddy auto-reconnect on sarvesh-1 and sarvesh-2
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (one-time setup, run from Sarvesh's Mac):
#
# For each host in the list (sarvesh-1 + sarvesh-2):
#   1. scp caddy-reconnect.sh → /home/deploy/caddy-reconnect.sh
#   2. Install an `@reboot` entry in the deploy user's own crontab that
#      runs caddy-reconnect.sh on every boot. (Via crontab, not systemd,
#      because deploy doesn't have passwordless sudo on these hosts.)
#   3. Run caddy-reconnect.sh once to reconcile current state.
#
# WHY CRON NOT SYSTEMD:
#
# Installing a system-wide systemd unit under /etc/systemd/system/
# requires root access. The deploy user on sarvesh-1/sarvesh-2 does NOT
# have passwordless sudo (only Saikat holds the sudo password). An
# earlier version of this script tried sudo and locked Sarvesh out of
# running the bootstrap at all.
#
# cron @reboot is the well-worn Linux equivalent: it runs arbitrary
# commands at boot under the user's own identity, with no elevated
# privileges needed. cron is installed by default on Ubuntu 24.04.
# caddy-reconnect.sh itself runs `docker network connect` which needs
# access to the Docker socket; the deploy user is already in the
# `docker` group (since that's how services deploy), so that works.
#
# Limitation: cron @reboot fires when the `cron` service starts, which
# is not strictly ordered after `docker.service`. caddy-reconnect.sh
# handles this by waiting up to 3 minutes for Docker + the caddy
# container to be up before attempting the reconnect.
#
# WHEN TO RE-RUN THIS SCRIPT:
#   - Once, after the initial Phase 3 deploy.
#   - If caddy-reconnect.sh changes in this repo and you want the new
#     version on the hosts.
#   - If sarvesh-1 or sarvesh-2 is replaced/reimaged.
#   - If the crontab entry is removed or the script is deleted.
#
# USAGE:
#
#   bash scripts/bootstrap-caddy-reconnect.sh
#
# SAFETY:
#
# - No sudo. No root. Operates entirely within the deploy user's scope.
# - Idempotent: scp overwrites the same path, crontab installation checks
#   for an existing entry and avoids duplicates.
# - `set -e` aborts on first error, so a failure on sarvesh-1 does NOT
#   silently leave sarvesh-2 half-configured.
