# yral-sarvesh-sentry — install / bootstrap script (runs ON sarvesh-3)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES, IN NUMBERED STEPS:
#
#   1. Sanity-check we're running on sarvesh-3 as the deploy user.
#   2. Load our project.config (SENTRY_VERSION, paths, etc.).
#   3. Clone `getsentry/self-hosted` at the pinned tag into
#      ${SENTRY_UPSTREAM_DIR} (default /opt/sentry-upstream) — or fast-forward
#      if already cloned to a different tag.
#   4. Copy our sentry/config.yml INTO the upstream sentry/ directory so
#      upstream's ensure-files-from-examples step keeps our version.
#   5. Append our sentry/sentry.conf.override.py to upstream's
#      sentry/sentry.conf.py (wrapped in markers for idempotent re-run).
#   6. Symlink our docker-compose.override.yml into the upstream root so
#      Compose auto-merges our resource limits + localhost bind.
#   7. Write `.env.custom` with the Google OAuth client ID + secret (read
#      from GitHub Secrets or the equivalent env vars on this shell).
#   8. Run upstream `./install.sh --skip-user-prompt` — this does the heavy
#      lifting: pulls images, generates Sentry's system.secret-key, migrates
#      Postgres, bootstraps Clickhouse and Snuba, etc. Takes 20-40 minutes
#      on first run.
#   9. Bring the stack up with `docker compose up -d`.
#  10. Verify `curl http://127.0.0.1:9000/_health/` returns "ok".
#
# HOW TO USE (first install):
#
#   On sarvesh-3, logged in as `deploy`:
#     cd /home/deploy/yral-sarvesh-sentry
#     export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<from-GitHub-secret>"
#     export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<from-GitHub-secret>"
#     bash scripts/install.sh
#
# HOW TO USE (re-run after config change):
#
#   Exactly the same command. The script is IDEMPOTENT — safe to run
#   repeatedly. On re-run it:
#     - leaves the upstream clone alone (unless SENTRY_VERSION changed,
#       in which case it checks out the new tag — that's the upgrade path,
#       handled more carefully by scripts/upgrade.sh)
#     - re-writes our config files (any local edits on sarvesh-3 get lost)
#     - re-runs upstream install.sh (which is itself idempotent)
#     - re-ups docker compose
#
# SAFETY: this script does NOT delete data volumes. `docker compose up -d`
# keeps existing Postgres/Clickhouse/Kafka state. Destructive operations
# (wiping a volume, rolling back a schema) are separate tools — see
# RUNBOOK.md once Phase 9 writes it.

UPSTREAM_CONF="${SENTRY_UPSTREAM_DIR}/sentry/sentry.conf.py"
BEGIN_MARKER="# --- BEGIN yral-sarvesh-sentry overrides ---"
END_MARKER="# --- END yral-sarvesh-sentry overrides ---"

# Upstream installs `sentry.conf.py` from `sentry.conf.example.py` only if
# `sentry.conf.py` doesn't already exist. If it doesn't exist yet (first
# install), copy the example so we have something to append to.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 6b: expose our clickhouse/config.d tuning file at a path the compose
# override can mount from. The compose override uses a RELATIVE bind path
# `./clickhouse/config.d/...` — that's relative to where `docker compose`
# runs, which is SENTRY_UPSTREAM_DIR, not our repo. Without this symlink,
# Docker would create an empty directory at the target (observed in the
# 2026-04-22 install attempt).
#
# We symlink our FILE (not the whole directory) because upstream's
# clickhouse/ directory is managed by upstream — we add our file under it
# without stepping on upstream's existing `clickhouse/config.xml`.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

mkdir -p "${SENTRY_UPSTREAM_DIR}/clickhouse/config.d"
ln -sf "${REPO_DIR}/clickhouse/config.d/00-small-host-tuning.xml" \
       "${SENTRY_UPSTREAM_DIR}/clickhouse/config.d/00-small-host-tuning.xml"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 7: write .env.custom.
#
# Upstream install.sh calls Docker Compose with `--env-file .env.custom`
# (if .env.custom exists) which means Compose reads ONLY .env.custom for
# variable interpolation and for passing env vars to containers — it does
# NOT also read .env. So every container env var our services need MUST be
# in .env.custom, not just in .env.
#
# Specifically, Sentry's Django SECRET_KEY is read from the env var
# SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY (see upstream sentry/sentry.conf.example.py:
# `if env("SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY"): SENTRY_OPTIONS["system.secret-key"] = ...`).
# If that env var is empty, Django fails on startup with
# "The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty."
#
# Upstream's own install/generate-secret-key.sh generates a key INTO
# sentry/config.yml (not into an env var) only if it finds the literal
# uncommented placeholder line `system.secret-key: '!!changeme!!'`. Our
# sentry/config.yml has that line commented out on purpose (we don't
# want a generated secret living in our git-tracked config file), so
# upstream's generator is a no-op for us.
#
# The fix: generate SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY ONCE on first install,
# persist it in .env.custom, and preserve it across re-runs so sessions
# don't get invalidated every time install.sh runs.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
echo "==> Writing .env.custom"

ENV_CUSTOM="${SENTRY_UPSTREAM_DIR}/.env.custom"

# If a SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY is already in .env.custom from a previous
# install, keep it. Generating a new one every run would invalidate every
# logged-in session. We only generate on the VERY first install.
if [[ -f "${ENV_CUSTOM}" ]] && grep -q "^SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY=" "${ENV_CUSTOM}"; then
  echo "    preserving existing SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY from prior install"
  # `cut -d= -f2-` gets everything after the first `=`. We then strip one
  # layer of matching single-quotes if present (we always write the value
  # single-quoted, see below, but an externally-edited file might not be).
  SECRET_KEY="$(grep "^SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY=" "${ENV_CUSTOM}" | cut -d= -f2-)"
  # Strip leading/trailing single quotes if both present.
  if [[ "${SECRET_KEY}" == \'*\' ]]; then
    SECRET_KEY="${SECRET_KEY:1:-1}"
  fi
else
  echo "    generating new SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY (first install)"
  # WHY this alphabet? Three constraints to satisfy simultaneously:
  #   - Sentry accepts any byte string for SECRET_KEY (no real constraint).
  #   - Bash must safely source `KEY=VALUE` lines from .env.custom, which
  #     means the value must not contain shell metacharacters like
  #     `&`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `#`, `^`, `$`, backtick, `'`, `"`, `;`, `|`,
  #     newline, etc. Upstream uses `a-z0-9@#%^&*(-_=+)` which is NOT
  #     shell-safe and broke our source step in attempt 6.
  #   - Docker Compose's own env-file parser must also handle it cleanly.
  # The safe intersection: alphanumeric (upper+lower+digits) plus `-` and
  # `_`. That's 64 chars = 6 bits of entropy each. 50 chars = 300 bits of
  # entropy, which is 5x what Django needs for its SECRET_KEY.
  #
  # WHY python3? A `tr -dc '<set>' </dev/urandom | head -c 50` pipeline
  # triggers SIGPIPE on tr when head exits (see attempt 5 failure).
  # python3 is available on Ubuntu 24.04 (sarvesh-3's OS) and has no
  # pipe-semantics gotchas.
  SECRET_KEY="$(python3 -c 'import secrets, string
alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "-_"
print("".join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(50)))')"
fi

# Write the full .env.custom. This file is chmod 600 (owner read/write only)
# because it contains secrets (system key + Google OAuth client secret).
# Never commit this file to git — it's created at install time on sarvesh-3
# and lives only there.
#
# WHY single-quote every value? Belt-and-braces. Our current alphabet for
# the system key (a-zA-Z0-9-_) is already shell-safe so quotes aren't
# strictly needed. But the OAuth values come from GitHub Secrets which we
# don't control — if Google ever issues a client secret with a `&` or `*`
# we'd hit the same bash syntax error we saw in attempt 6. Single-quoting
# defensively makes this class of bug impossible. Docker Compose's
# env-file parser strips matching outer quotes, so there's no downside.

# references, not for bare `environment: KEY:` entries.
#
# Without this sourcing, `docker compose up -d` passes empty
# SENTRY_SYSTEM_SECRET_KEY to web, web's Django initialization fails
# with "The SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty", and web stays
# unhealthy forever.

#   --no-report-self-hosted-issues say NO to Sentry's telemetry opt-in. This
#                                  is a privacy choice — our internal infra
