# yral-sarvesh-sentry — Caddy → sentry-web overlay re-attachment (runs on sarvesh-1/sarvesh-2)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#
# Ensures the `caddy` Docker container on THIS host is attached to the
# `sentry-web` Swarm overlay network. If it's already attached, the script
# is a no-op (idempotent). If not, the script connects it.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS:
#
# Caddy's attachment to the `sentry-web` overlay is a RUNTIME property of
# the container. It does NOT persist across container restarts. A reboot,
# crash, or `docker restart caddy` forgets the attachment, after which
# sentry.sarvesh.yral.com returns 502 from this host.
#
# The existing dolr-ai service template (yral-sarvesh-hetzner-infra-template)
# hides this same gap because `scripts/ci/deploy-app.sh` re-runs
# `docker network connect` on every app deploy — and services redeploy
# frequently. Sentry doesn't have that cadence (upgrades are monthly at
# most), so it needs a separate reconnect mechanism.
#
# HOW THIS SCRIPT IS TRIGGERED:
#
# 1. On boot of sarvesh-1/sarvesh-2, via the systemd unit
#    `sentry-caddy-reconnect.service` (installed by
#    scripts/bootstrap-caddy-reconnect.sh).
# 2. Manually by an operator after an unplanned Caddy restart
#    (see yral-sarvesh-sentry/RUNBOOK.md).
# 3. Optionally from any remote host via SSH if you want to reconcile
#    state quickly.
#
# WHERE THIS SCRIPT LIVES ON sarvesh-1 / sarvesh-2:
#
# `/home/yral-deploy/caddy-reconnect.sh` — installed by
# `scripts/bootstrap-caddy-reconnect.sh`. The systemd unit points to this
# fixed path so the script has a stable home regardless of where (or
# whether) the yral-sarvesh-sentry repo is cloned on the host.
